# 𒆜 leger

**a calm place to remember what you’ve given and received**

`leger` is a minimal web prototype of a new app exploring trust, memory, and reciprocity.  
inspired by sumerian tablets — the first ledgers of human exchange.

### concept
- not about money
- about memory and fairness
- each entry is a small act of acknowledgment

### usage
open your ledger.  
record something you’ve given or received.  
everything is stored locally — private, calm, yours.
